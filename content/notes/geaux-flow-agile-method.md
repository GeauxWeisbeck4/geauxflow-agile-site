The biggest thing I must make clear before getting into anything else is this - I am not professional psychologist, focus coach, ADHD Meds Distributor, etc. This is what has worked for me and I like it - you probably won't like it as much as me unless you take it, twist it, turn it, and make it into the "[Your Rad Workflow Name]-Flow Agile Method".

Yes, I want you to do whatever you want with this - steal it, break it, make fun of it, sell it, throw it in a black hole - I just want you to be happy. Oh, and I want you to find flow... a deep-focus mental state that the famous Mikael Chikzyentialov calls "Flow".

Now, onto the good stuff.

## About the Geaux Flow Agile Method

I am writing an accumulative history of the Geaux Flow Agile Method as you are reading this. I will probably publish it as a New York Time Best Selling E-book on Gumroad or just share the notes version of it for free. Either way, it's pretty awesome!

Until then, just know that this method has taken years of research, trying things, throwing things away, crying, laughing, blood-shot eyes, failures, successes, many more failures, and sharing things. I doubt it will ever reach a state of homeostasis - the Geaux-Flow is forever in a constant state of adaptation because:

- There are many more experienced, more productive, and more trained agile experts out there than me. (I read the agile manifesto and am a software developer so I basically qualify for renowned expert, but I'm just being humble :->)
- New ideas emerge that make old ideas obsolete, enhance them, or are shiny and look cool but actually really suck when you try them.
- Change is my middle name - I am the most dynamic mo'f****** you ever met. For real, I am always seeking feedback and incorporating it into what I do.
- Being number two is my only fear - I have never not been number one so I must stay ahead of the game to stay on top. Just kidding, but I want every competitive advantage I can get for my career, my business, and my life.
- It is basically a digital garden - the whole idea of a digital garden is planting, nurturing, growing, trimming, and bringing ideas to fruition. By working in public, using knowledge capturing/sharing, and threading ideas, we can create new awesome things that the world aint ready for yet.

There are so many people I need to give credit to for this, but here are the main ones off the top of my head:

- [Cal Newport, author of *Deep Work*](https://calnewport.com)
- [Maggie Appleton, digital garden extraordinaire and essayist](https://maggieappleton.com)
- [Tich Nacht Hanh, Awesome Vietnamese Buddhist Monk who makes me smile whenever I think about him](https://tichnachthanh.com)
- [Pema Chodron - badass buddhist monk and author](https://pemachodron.com)
- [Amos Taversky and Daniel Kahneman, authors of *Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow*](https://thinkingfastthinkingslow.com)
- [MLK JR, greatest change artist who ever existed](https://mlkjr.com)

There is more to come.

This is essentially the work flow. Each step should take you to a different note so it can explain each in detail.
