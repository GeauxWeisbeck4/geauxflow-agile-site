# Andrew's Deep Focus Agile Workflow

This website is a public agile workflow where I plan, share, and track my work in public as part of my digital garden. This allows for accountability and provides me with motivation to stay on track and share my work with the public. Further down the line, I would like to incorporate features that allow for easy collaboration with others.

## This Project is a Component of My Digital Garden

This is a part of my Digital Garden that I share on the web. This specific site is where you can follow my agile planning and tracking. I am trying to really follow a deep focus workflow to help me be more productive and efficient with my time.[1]

[1] I suggest reading Cal Newports, Deep Work to learn more about deep work.
