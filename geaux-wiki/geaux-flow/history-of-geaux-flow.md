## How It All Started

I have always been obsessed with psychology, productivity, and deep focus - well not always, but it seems like I always have been because these topics intertwine with work, happiness, and mental health. Without getting into all the gory details of what led to me on this path (you can find more about that at another time), let's go ahead and pick up at this point...

*...some freezing cold day in Bozeman, MT in 2016..*

My ADHD had really wresteld away my engergy during this time in my life - if it wasn't something that I was absolutely interested in, I would become exhausted, unable to sit still and work, and really would fall into a toxic version of myself. I was trying to "get sober" (really just needed to quit drinking), and some of those consequences from that time kept me from getting my Adderall prescription - well that and being stigmatized kept me from getting my adderall prescription.

If you don't understand what innattentive ADHD is and what it looks like, you would meet me and think, "No way that guy has ADHD - he's too mellow!" I am a pretty chill dude. But not everyone with ADHD bounces off walls and becomes a crack head - many people are not aware that they have Adult ADD/ADHD actually and it wreaks havoc on many peoples lives.

More on ADHD for sure at another, but you got the idea - I'm always dragging, struggling to find interest in work and life, and what I didn't understand at the time was that I totally bought into my ego, and by that I mean identifying with this idea of "Andrew".

This mid-to-late-20s crisis was unnecessary and it makes me sad to think back on it, but there were some good things that came from it. *The greatest part of this time in my  life was that I learned about Buddhism, Mindfulness, Therapy, Yoga, and did many things that tried to tie these all together to make me feel happy.*

Needless to say, they didn't make me happy (I'll explain shortly) even though these things can make you happy. If I'm honest, I think I was looking for something to replace alcohol with which to me is not the purpose of doing any of these things and I am a believer that you don't need to replace a bad habit with something else.*

> *Well, I really am a non-believer in AA/12-Steps and think they can be toxic and damaging to certain individuals, but that is for another time

While all these awesome practices didn't make me happy, they would eventually become a base or grounding point for myself later on in life to help me deal with my mental health. All the hours of writing, reading books, meditating, doing yoga, thinking, and everything else really have allowed me to be a really happy person now. At the time, I felt like I was running on an uphill hamster wheel because they didn't make me feel like I was expecting to feel.

What happened though is that all of these things became habits and became so automatic, that I sometimes have to stop and bring attention to the fact that I am being aware of the moment without being aware of that awareness - I challenge you to stop and be aware of that statement and think about it for a moment... pretty heady right? :)

I no longer have panic attack inducing anxiety and stress like I used to because my coping mechanisms are automatic when something happens - it's helped me cope with the shitty situation I'm in now for over two years actually. That's not to say all my mental health and personal issues have disappeared, because they certainly haven't. But what has happened is that I no longer feel like I need to stop those feelings with booze or anything else, but instead I can allow myself to feel them in their entire existence within myself... and when you really think about it, that is living life in the moment/living life to the fullest extent/taking it all in.

You are experiencing everything that you are a part of in that exact moment with your total awareness and when you can understand what I mean by that or know what that feels like, it is like opening the secret book of life knowledge. From there you stop identifying with ego, realizing we are all from the same source of life, and you lose all care of material things and real world problems forever!! (Ok, not really but I've gotten basically to that point!)
